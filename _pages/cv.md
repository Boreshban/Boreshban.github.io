# TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE


* <b>Machine Learning Engineer, Sharif University of Technology </b>, Tehran, Iran, 2018 - 2023
   *  performed research on improving robustness in the NLP, especially in question-answering(QA).
   *  implemented the active learning approach to QA systems to reduce labeling costs.
   *  analyzed the effects of the knowledge distillation method on the robustness of QA systems for reducing computational complexity.
   *  Researched and developed an open-source framework for NLP modelsâ€™ robustness analysis.
   *  Investigated the effect of quantization on the robustness of Transformer-based NLP text classifiers.
   *  Implemented various machine and deep learning methods such as SVM, Regression, Adaboost, random forest, k-means, CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, GAN, and Autoencoder on various datasets.
   *  developed various image processing approaches based on the OpenCV library, such as Histogram equalization, deconvolution, inverse filtering, hough transform, smoothing, and style transfer.
