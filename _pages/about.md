I finished my Ph.D. program in the NLP Lab of the [Department of Computer Engineering](http://ce.sharif.edu/) at Sharif University of Technology in 2023. My thesis title was "Improving the Robustness of the Question Answering Systems Using Deep Neural Networks". My supervisor was [Dr. Gholamreza Ghassem-Sani](http://sharif.edu/~sani/), and My advisor was [Dr. Seyed Abolghasem Mirroshandel](https://nlp.guilan.ac.ir/mirroshandel/).  

I'm interested in the interplay between text and image, such as Visual question-answering systems and caption generation. I'm also interested in applying machine learning methods to medical data.

My research interests include machine learning,  Deep Learning, and natural language processing. You can find more information at [Publication](https://boreshban.github.io/publications/) and [CV](https://boreshban.github.io/cv/).
