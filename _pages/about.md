I finished my Ph.D. program in the NLP Lab of the [Department of Computer Engineering](http://ce.sharif.edu/) at Sharif University of Technology in 2023. My thesis title was "Improving the Robustness of the Question Answering Systems Using Deep Neural Networks". My supervisor was [Dr. Gholamreza Ghassem-Sani](http://sharif.edu/~sani/), and My advisor was [Dr. Seyed Abolghasem Mirroshandel](https://nlp.guilan.ac.ir/mirroshandel/).  

My research interests include machine learning,  Deep Learning, and natural language processing. You can find more information at [Publication](https://boreshban.github.io/publications/) and [CV](https://boreshban.github.io/cv/).
