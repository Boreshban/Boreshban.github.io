I'm a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Engineering](http://ce.sharif.edu/), Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. My supervisor is  [Dr. Gholamreza Ghassem-Sani](http://sharif.edu/~sani/), and My advisor is [Dr. Seyed Abolghasem Mirroshandel](https://nlp.guilan.ac.ir/mirroshandel/).
 My Thesis focuses on robustness in the text domain, especially on Question Answering (QA) systems. 
 
I'm interested in the interplay between text and image, such as Visual question-answering systems and caption generation. I'm also interested in applying machine learning methods to medical data.

My research interests include machine learning,  Deep Learning, and natural language processing. You can find more information at [Publication](https://boreshban.github.io/publications/) and [CV](https://boreshban.github.io/cv/).
