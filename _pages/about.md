I'm a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Engineering](http://ce.sharif.edu/), Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. My supervisor is  [Dr. Gholamreza Ghassem-Sani](http://sharif.edu/~sani/), and My advisor is [Dr. Seyed Abolghasem Mirroshandel](https://nlp.guilan.ac.ir/mirroshandel/).
 My Thesis focuses on robustness in the text domain, especially on Question Answering (QA) systems. 
I'm interested in the interplay between text and image, such as Visual question answering systems, caption generation, etc. 
 I'm also interested in applying machine learning and deep learning methods to medical data, such as Biomedical Question answering. 
Currently, I'm participating in another project about sperm abnormality detection using human sperm images.
My research interests include machine learning,  Deep Learning, and natural language processing. You can find more information at [Publication](https://boreshban.github.io/publications/) and [CV](https://boreshban.github.io/cv/).
